{::
  Want nested comments like {: this :} to easily comment out some content?
  That's not a very good idea as raw text may contain the closing tag.
  So manually editing nested comments in such situations is tiresome.
  No, there is no nested comment nor other special characters in this block.

  Do you mean {# ignored {# nested } structure } ?
::}

{:
  {?bml ... } is a very special block. Please ignore it for now.

  BML aims to make minimal use of markers and special characters!
  But that just tells my No.2 dislike of XML.
  The No.1 is that there is no real reason not to prefer XML for now.

  XML documents can be converted to BML documents but not the other way around?
  But actually I never read the full specs of XML :P
  And no time & no energy for the development of tool chains around BML.

    Normally, curly brackets \{\} and \| in text need to be escaped with \\.

    {|||{
      To insert blocks of text which contains a lot of {} you can surround the
      text with: {{ and }}, or {|{ and }|}, or {||{ and }||}, and so on.

      No special syntax is recognizable in this block.
    }|||}

    Blocks can be optionally ended with their tag names prefixed by \|.

    There must be no content between the tag name and \{ or \}.
