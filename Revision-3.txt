  BML aims to make minimal use of markers and special characters!
  But that just tells my No.2 dislike of XML.
  The No.1 is that there is no real reason not to prefer XML for now.

    Normally, curly brackets \{\} and \| in text need to be escaped with \\.

      To insert a block of text which contains a lot of {} and |\
      you can surround the text with: {` `} or {`` ``} or {``` ```} and so on.

      No special syntax is recognizable in this block.
    ````}

    Blocks can be optionally ended with their tag names prefixed by \|.

  Want nested comments like {{ this }} to easily comment out some content?
  That's not a very good idea as raw text may contain the closing tag.
  So manually editing nested comments in such situations is tiresome.
  No, there is no nested comment nor other special characters in this block.

  Do you mean {| ignored {| nested } structure |} ?

  And no wonder people might create template languages in BML documents like...
      {{template birthday-card name |
          {card | Happy Birthday to You, {name}! }
      |template}}
  Hard to tell if that is a good idea.
